Description:

Introducing Jarvis, your personal AI assistant built with Python! Inspired by Iron Man's intelligent companion, Jarvis is designed to respond to your voice commands and perform actions on your desktop.

Features:

Voice Control: Interact with Jarvis hands-free by issuing voice commands.
Web Navigation: Open websites like YouTube or Google Chrome by simply saying "Open YouTube" or "Open Google." (Specify additional apps you want Jarvis to control)
Customization: Train Jarvis to recognize your voice and personalize responses. (Note: Requires additional setup)
Technical Overview:

Speech Recognition: Jarvis utilizes libraries like SpeechRecognition to convert your spoken commands into text.
Text-to-Speech (Optional): For a more interactive experience, Jarvis can respond with synthesized speech using libraries like pyttsx3.
Action Execution: Based on your voice command, Jarvis interacts with your system using libraries like webbrowser to open websites or potentially custom scripts to launch specific applications.
